    <h1>I'm the Alibeez-to-Google-Calendar Connector</h1>
    <p>
      I will synchronize your leaves of absence from Alibeez to Google Calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      More precisely, when you create a leave request in Alibeez, I will add a
      corresponding event in your primary calendar within the next hour. I
      don't wait for the leave request to be validated. Furthermore, if you
      cancel a leave in Alibeez, I will remove the event your calendar.
    </p>
    <p>For this to work, I need your permission to access your calendar.</p>
